Darin Word â€“ COMP 163, Fall 2025
This comes as a Python-written process for the personal portfolios, professionally dishing out academicals, personal and financial details. It uses the basic data structures of Python such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets and supports functionalities like GPA calculation, study hours, and budget tracking. The use of Git for version controlling has also been put into the project, so that everything in development processes has been accounted for in buggy, descriptive commits.
